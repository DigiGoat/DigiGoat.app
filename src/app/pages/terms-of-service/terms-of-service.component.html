    <h2 id="acceptance">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p> By accessing or using the Service, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, you
      may not use the Service. If you are using the Service on behalf of a business, farm, or other entity, you represent that you have
      authority to bind that entity to these Terms. </p>
    <h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility and Account Registration</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> You must have the legal capacity and authority to enter into these Terms. If you are under the age of majority where you live,
        you may use the Service only with involvement and consent of a parent or legal guardian who agrees to be responsible for your use.

    </ul>
    <h2 id="service">3. The Service</h2>
    <p> DigiGoat is designed to help you create, manage, and publish a public-facing website for your farm or herd and to keep certain
      information up to date (for example, by syncing registration and pedigree data from third-party sources). </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>No affiliation:</strong> DigiGoat is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by ADGA, CDCB, or any other third-party
        organization unless explicitly stated.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No guarantee of accuracy:</strong> We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or timeliness of third-party data or that
        sync features will always be available.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Setup timeline:</strong> After you subscribe, initial setup (for example: provisioning hosting, analytics, and domain/DNS
        changes you request) may take time and is typically completed within <strong>5–7 business days</strong>, though timing may vary.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Availability:</strong> We aim for reliable operation, but the Service may be unavailable from time to time and may change.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="customer-content">4. Your Content and Your Site</h2>
    <p> The Service may allow you to upload, enter, create, or publish content, including text, images, herd/goat information, and other
      materials (collectively, "Customer Content"). </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">4.1 Ownership</h3>
    <p> As between you and DigiGoat, you retain ownership of your Customer Content, subject to the licenses you grant in these Terms and any
      rights of third parties. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">4.2 License to Operate the Service</h3>
    <p> You grant DigiGoat a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host, store, cache, reproduce, transmit, display, and
      distribute your Customer Content solely as necessary to provide, maintain, secure, and improve the Service and to publish your
      website(s) as you direct. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">4.3 Your Responsibilities</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You are responsible for your Customer Content and your published website(s), including ensuring you have all necessary rights.
      </li>
      <li>You agree not to upload or publish content that is unlawful, infringing, defamatory, or violates others’ privacy rights.</li>
      <li> You are responsible for any notices, disclosures, consents, and legal pages (including your own privacy policy/cookie
        disclosures) required for your public website. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">4.4 Public Nature of Published Sites</h3>
    <p> If you publish a site through the Service, it may be publicly available on the internet and indexed by search engines. You control
      what information you choose to publish. </p>
    <h2 id="acceptable-use">5. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to misuse the Service. In particular, you will not (and will not attempt to):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract source code, except to the extent permitted by applicable law.</li>
      <li>Circumvent technical restrictions, security measures, or access controls.</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure (including via automated or abusive traffic).</li>
      <li>Use the Service to distribute malware, spam, or content that is unlawful, fraudulent, or harmful.</li>
      <li>Access, scrape, or harvest data from the Service in a way that violates applicable law or our reasonable usage limits.</li>
      <li>Attempt to access another user’s account, data, or sites without authorization.</li>
    </ul>
    <p> We may investigate violations and may suspend or terminate accounts for conduct that violates these Terms or creates risk for the
      Service, other users, or third parties. </p>
    <h2 id="subscriptions">6. Subscriptions, Billing, and Taxes</h2>
    <p> Subscriptions are billed in advance on a recurring basis and automatically renew unless canceled before the end of the current
      billing period. DigiGoat subscriptions are typically billed <strong>annually</strong>. Pricing is presented at checkout and may
      include discounts or promotional offers. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment processing:</strong> Payments are processed by a third-party payment processor (such as Stripe). DigiGoat does not
        store your full payment card details.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Checkout and billing portal:</strong> Because DigiGoat is delivered through a statically-generated website, checkout and
        subscription management may be provided through Stripe-hosted pages. For example, <strong>buy.digigoat.app</strong> may redirect to
        a Stripe checkout/payment link and <strong>billing.digigoat.app</strong> may redirect to the Stripe customer portal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Authorization:</strong> By providing payment information, you authorize us (and our payment processor) to charge applicable
        fees and taxes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Price changes:</strong> Prices may change with reasonable notice. Changes typically take effect at the next renewal.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Taxes:</strong> Fees are exclusive of taxes unless stated otherwise. You are responsible for any applicable taxes, duties,
        or similar governmental assessments.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="cancellation">7. Cancellation</h2>
    <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time.</p>
    <ul>
      <li> By default, cancellation takes effect at the <strong>end of the current billing period</strong>, and your site and access will
        remain active until that time. </li>
      <li>Upon request, DigiGoat may take down or transfer your site earlier at no additional charge.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="refunds">8. Refund Policy</h2>
    <p> If you request a refund within <strong>30 days of onboarding</strong> and the refund is approved, DigiGoat will issue a refund equal
      to <strong>50% of the subscription fees you paid to DigiGoat</strong> for the applicable subscription. </p>
    <p> For purposes of this Refund Policy, <strong>"onboarding"</strong> means the date we complete initial setup and your DigiGoat site is
      made available to you (or, if earlier, the date your subscription begins). </p>
    <p> Refund requests made <strong>more than 30 days after onboarding</strong> are not eligible for a refund, except where required by
      law. </p>
    <p> Fees charged by third parties (for example: domain registration/renewal fees, taxes, and other non-refundable pass-through costs)
      are not refundable. </p>
    <p>If you request a refund (whether approved or not), you acknowledge that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your site will be immediately taken offline</li>
      <li>You may permanently lose access to your site and associated data</li>
      <li>DigiGoat may choose to delete your associated repository and/or project resources, which may result in loss of data</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Approved refunds are issued to the original payment method when possible. We may decline refund requests in cases of suspected
      fraud, abuse, or where prohibited by law. </p>
    <h2 id="domains">9. Domains, DNS, and Email</h2>
    <p> If you request that DigiGoat register, transfer, or manage a domain name, you authorize us to act on your behalf with a third-party
      domain registrar and related providers. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Third-party terms:</strong> Domain registration, transfer, and DNS services are subject to the applicable registrar’s terms
        and policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>No guarantee:</strong> We do not guarantee that a requested domain will be available, renewable, or transferable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Ownership and control:</strong> Domain ownership and control are governed by registrar records and policies. You are
        responsible for keeping registration contact information accurate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Email:</strong> If the Service includes custom email features, those features may be provided through third parties and may
        require acceptance of additional terms.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="third-parties">10. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p> The Service may integrate with or rely on third-party services (for example: payment processors such as Stripe, domain registrars
      such as Porkbun, analytics services, and third-party data sources such as ADGA or CDCB). Third-party services are not under our
      control, and their terms and privacy policies apply. </p>
    <p> DigiGoat is not responsible for third-party services, including their availability, accuracy, or security, and your use of them is
      at your own risk. </p>
    <h2 id="ip">11. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p> The Service (excluding Customer Content), including software, code, designs, trademarks, logos, and other content provided by
      DigiGoat, is owned by DigiGoat and is protected by intellectual property laws. </p>
    <p> Some components of DigiGoat may be made available publicly (for example, via a source code repository) under separate license terms.
      Those license terms govern your use of any publicly available code. </p>
    <p> You may not use DigiGoat’s trademarks, logos, or branding without our prior written permission, except as needed to truthfully
      reference DigiGoat as a service provider. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">11.1 Copyright and IP Complaints</h3>
    <p> If you believe content on the Service (including a site published through the Service) infringes your copyright or other
      intellectual property rights, please contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:support@digigoat.app">support&#64;digigoat.app</a></strong>
      with enough detail for us to investigate (for example: the specific URL, a description of the work you believe was infringed, and your
      contact information). We may remove or disable access to allegedly infringing content and may terminate repeat infringers where
      appropriate. </p>
    <h2 id="feedback">12. Feedback</h2>
    <p> If you provide suggestions, ideas, or feedback about the Service ("Feedback"), you grant DigiGoat a perpetual, irrevocable,
      worldwide, royalty-free license to use, modify, and incorporate that Feedback without restriction or compensation. </p>
    <h2 id="termination">13. Suspension and Termination</h2>
    <p> We may suspend or terminate your access immediately if you violate these Terms, if payment fails, or if your use poses a security or
      legal risk. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upon termination, your right to use the Service ends.</li>
      <li>We may delete Customer Content after termination, and it may not be recoverable.</li>
      <li>Sections that by their nature should survive termination (e.g., limitation of liability, indemnity) will survive.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="disclaimers">14. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p> The Service is provided <strong>"as is" and "as available"</strong>, without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including
      warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. </p>
    <p> We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure, or that the Service will meet your requirements.
    </p>
    <h2 id="limitation">15. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p> To the maximum extent permitted by law, DigiGoat shall not be liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive
      damages, or for loss of profits, revenue, data, goodwill, or business opportunities. </p>
    <p> DigiGoat’s total liability for all claims arising out of or relating to the Service shall not exceed the amount paid by you to
      DigiGoat in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. </p>
    <h2 id="indemnity">16. Indemnification</h2>
    <p> You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless DigiGoat and its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and contractors from and

    <p> We may modify the Service or these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide reasonable notice (for
      example, by posting an updated date on this page or through the Service). Your continued use of the Service after changes become
      effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms. </p>
    <h2 id="law">18. Governing Law; Venue</h2>
    <p> These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to conflict of law principles. </p>
    <p> Except where prohibited by law, you agree that any dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service will be brought
      exclusively in the state or federal courts located in Washington, and you consent to personal jurisdiction and venue in those courts.

      <li><strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision is unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain in effect.</li>
