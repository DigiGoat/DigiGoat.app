      accordance with their policies. For more information, see Stripe’s <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy" target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer">Privacy Policy</a>. </p>
    <h2 id="public">8. Public Content and Published Sites</h2>
    <p> If you publish a website through the Service, that website (and any information you choose to publish on it) may be publicly
      available and indexed by search engines. Please be thoughtful about what you publish. </p>
    <h2 id="retention">9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p> We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Service, comply with legal obligations, resolve
      disputes, and enforce our agreements. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Account and subscription records are typically retained for the duration of your relationship with us and as required by law.</li>
      <li>Analytics and logs are generally retained for a limited period, subject to provider settings and operational needs.</li>
      <li> If your account is terminated, your data may be deleted and may not be recoverable. If you need a copy of your content, contact
        us before cancelling or requesting deletion. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="security">10. Security</h2>
    <p> We take reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational measures designed to protect personal information. However, no
      method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. </p>
    <h2 id="international">11. International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p> DigiGoat is based in the United States. If you access the Service from outside the United States, your information may be processed
      and stored in the United States or other jurisdictions where we or our service providers operate. </p>
    <h2 id="rights">12. Your Choices and Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p> Depending on where you live, you may have rights regarding your personal information. These may include the right to access,
      correct, delete, or receive a copy of your information, and to object to or restrict certain processing. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">12.1 Account choices</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>You can update certain account information by contacting us.</li>

    </ul>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">12.2 U.S. state privacy disclosures</h3>
    <p> We do not sell personal information. We also do not knowingly share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
      If you have questions about our practices or want to exercise applicable rights, contact us. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">12.3 Exercising your rights</h3>
    <p> To submit a privacy request, contact us at <strong><a href="mailto:support@digigoat.app">support&#64;digigoat.app</a></strong>. We
      may ask you to verify your identity before responding. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">12.4 EEA/UK legal bases (where applicable)</h3>
    <p> If you are located in the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom, we process personal information only where we have a valid
      legal basis, such as: (a) to perform a contract with you (to provide the Service), (b) to comply with legal obligations, (c) where you
      have provided consent (for example, where required for certain cookies/analytics), or (d) our legitimate interests (such as securing
      and improving the Service), except where those interests are overridden by your rights. </p>
    <h3 class="h5 mt-3">12.5 Do Not Track</h3>
    <p> Some browsers send “Do Not Track” (DNT) signals. Because there is not a consistent industry standard for DNT, we do not respond to
      DNT signals in a uniform way. </p>
    <h2 id="children">13. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p> The Service is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If
      you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action. </p>
