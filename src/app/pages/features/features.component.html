        <section id="works-with-adga" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Works with ADGA</h2>
          <p> No more copy/paste. What used to be hours of entering goats one by one, having to look up the same information each time, is
            now just the click of a button. </p>
          <p> When editing your goats, a convenient <code>Sync All</code> button fetches all your owned goats, their registration info (such
            as name, id, etc.), and all the necessary goats ("related goats") to automatically construct a pedigree. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="personalized-recommendations" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Personalized recommendations</h2>
          <p> Some things just aren't worth your time, like if your goats' barn names are always the last word in their registered name.
          </p>
          <p> DigiGoat suggests those details for you so all you have to do is click the input box and it's filled in. The same goes for
            setting up your website for the first time—DigiGoat suggests copy so you don't have to wonder what to write. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="open-graph-protocol" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Open Graph Protocol</h2>
          <p> Goat pages support the Open Graph Protocol so that when you share a goat's page on social media, it looks great and includes
            the right information—name, description, and pictures. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="optimized-for-search-engines" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Optimized For Search Engines</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat is optimized for search engines so your site can rank higher in search results and help more people find your herd.
          </p>
          <p> Pages are rendered in a way that search engines can easily understand, instead of the opaque blobs many website builders
            produce. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="analytics-support" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Analytics Support</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat comes with built-in support for Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity. This means that you can track how many people
            visit your website and what they do on it, from page views and traffic sources to heatmaps and session recordings. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="indexnow-support" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">IndexNow Support</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat supports IndexNow so that when you publish changes, DigiGoat automatically detects which pages are modified and
            notifies search engines, helping your site stay fresh in search results. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="works-offline" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Works offline</h2>
          <p> The biggest downfall of many web-based editors is that they require an active internet connection. DigiGoat lets you work
            offline so you can add new photos and updates right away and publish when you're back on a reliable connection. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="internet-efficient" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Internet Efficient</h2>
          <p> Unlike most website editors that require a constant, high-speed connection, DigiGoat only uses the internet when it's actually
            needed—such as syncing with ADGA or when you publish changes. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="open-source" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Open source</h2>
          <p> Every fragment of DigiGoat's code is fully public for inspection. You can rest easy knowing there's no hidden behavior behind
            your farm's website. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="community-driven" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Community driven</h2>
          <p> New features are based on public request. If you have an idea that would make your farm website better, you can share it and
            help shape DigiGoat's roadmap. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="personalized-support" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Personalized support</h2>
          <p> Support comes from a real person who can remember your farm and setup, instead of a faceless call center. You don't have to
            play 20 questions every time you need a hand. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="view-live-preview" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">View live preview</h2>
          <p> You can view a live preview of your website as you edit it. This lets you see exactly what your site will look like before you
            publish, so you can catch layout or content issues early. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="live-preview-with-gfm-markdown-support" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Live preview with GFM Markdown support</h2>
          <p> The live preview supports GitHub Flavored Markdown, so you can use Markdown to format text on your website and see the result
            in real time—even using an offline compiler that closely matches the online one. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="live-preview-works-offline" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Live preview works offline</h2>
          <p> The live preview itself works offline, so you can keep refining your content and layout even when you don't have an internet
            connection. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="spa" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">SPA</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat is a Single Page Application (SPA), which means your website feels fast and responsive. After the initial load,
            navigating around your site doesn't require full page reloads. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="optimized-image-loading" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Optimized Image Loading</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat uses lazy loading so images are loaded only when they're needed, while still ensuring key goat photos appear
            immediately when a page is opened. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="automated-seo" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Automated SEO</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat includes automated SEO so your website is optimized for search engines by default, without you having to manage
            complex settings. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="ad-free" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Ad-Free</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat is ad-free, so there are no distracting ads on your website—just your farm and your goats. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="custom-domain" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Custom Domain</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat includes a custom domain so you can have your own address, like <code>www.yourfarm.com</code>, instead of a generic
            subdomain. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="custom-emails" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Custom Emails</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat supports custom email addresses like <code>info&#64;yourfarm.com</code> or <code>support&#64;yourfarm.com</code> to
            match your domain and keep your farm communication professional. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="price" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Price</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat is competitively priced at $100/year. While it may be more than the entry-level plans on some builders, it includes
            many features that would otherwise be extra—especially when you factor in a custom domain. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="youth-discount" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">Youth Discount</h2>
          <p> Recognizing that $100/year can be a lot for a 4-H project, DigiGoat offers a youth discount to make it more accessible. </p>
        </section>
        <section id="test-coverage" class="mb-5">
          <h2 class="h4 mb-3">100% Test Coverage</h2>
          <p> DigiGoat has 100% test coverage, meaning every part of the system is exercised by automated tests to help ensure reliability
            as the platform evolves. </p>
